# Examples

This folder contains example configuration files in four
supported formats. You can use any format you want for
the config file, just give it the appropriate suffix for
the format. An XML file should end with `.xml`, a JSON
file with `.json`, and YAML with `.yaml`. The default
format is always TOML and may have any _other_ suffix.
