# If the controller has more than one site, specify which sites to poll here.
# Set this to "default" to poll only the first site on the controller.
# A setting of "all" will poll all sites; this works if you only have 1 site too.
sites:
  - all

# The UniFi Controller only updates traffic stats about every 30 seconds.
# Setting this to something lower may lead to "zeros" in your data. You've been warned.
interval: "30s"

# Turns on line numbers, microsecond logging, and a per-device log.
# The default is false, but I personally leave this on at home (four devices).
# This may be noisy if you have a lot of devices. It adds one line per device.
debug: false

# Turns off per-interval logs. Only startup and error logs will be emitted.
# Recommend enabling debug with this setting for better error logging.
quiet: false

# Which mode to run this application in. The default mode is "influx". Providing
# an invalid mode will also result in "influx". In this default mode the application
# runs as a daemon and polls the controller at the configured interval.
#
# There is only one other option at this time: "influxlambda"
#
# Lambda mode makes the application exit after collecting and reporting metrics
# to InfluxDB one time. This mode requires an external process like an AWS Lambda
# or a simple crontab to keep the timings accurate on UniFi Poller run intervals.
mode: "influx"

# If the poller experiences an error from the UniFi controller or from InfluxDB
# it will exit. If you do not want it to exit, change max_errors to -1. You can
# adjust the config to tolerate more errors by setting this to a higher value.
# Recommend setting this between 0 and 5. See man page for more explanation.
max_errors: 0

# InfluxDB does not require auth by default, so the user/password are probably unimportant.
