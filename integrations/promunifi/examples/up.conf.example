# Mode "influxlambda" makes the application exit after collecting and reporting metrics
# to InfluxDB one time. This mode requires an external process like an AWS Lambda
# or a simple crontab to keep the timings accurate on UniFi Poller run intervals.

# Mode "prometheus" opens an HTTP server on port 9130 and exports the metrics at
# /metrics for polling collection by a prometheus server. This disables influxdb.

# Mode "both" runs the Prometheus HTTP server and InfluxDB poller interval at
# the same time.
